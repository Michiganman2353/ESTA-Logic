## 🎯 Voice & Tone Pillars

### 1. Professional Calm

- Speak with authority but never intimidate
- Use confident, measured language
- Avoid exclamation overload or false excitement
- Present information with quiet confidence

**Example:**

> ❌ "WARNING! You must complete this now!"  
> ✅ "Let's complete this step to keep you compliant."

### 2. Guided Clarity

- One concept at a time
- Simple, conversational language
- Avoid legal jargon unless necessary (and always explain it)
- Use active voice and direct address

**Example:**

> ❌ "Documentation submission is required for regulatory compliance purposes."  
> ✅ "Let's securely store the documentation you need to stay compliant."

### 3. Legal Confidence

- Ground users in legal accuracy without fear
- Reference law clearly but simply
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Transform legal requirements into clear actions

**Example:**

> ❌ "Per MCL 408.9xx, accrual calculations must conform to statutory parameters."  
> ✅ "Michigan law requires 1 hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked. We calculate this automatically."

### 4. Human Reassurance

- Acknowledge the user's situation
- Validate concerns without amplifying fear
- Show progress clearly
- Celebrate completions, not just tasks
- Use "we" not "you" (we're in this together)

**Example:**

> ❌ "You failed to enter a valid company name."  
> ✅ "Company name is needed. This helps us ensure you're compliant with Michigan law."

## 🗣️ Language Model

### Instead of → Say This

| ❌ Avoid                                                                 | ✅ Use Instead                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Upload supporting documentation now or your compliance may be at risk." | "Let's securely store the documentation you need to remain compliant. We'll guide you through exactly what's required." |
| "Error: Invalid input"                                                   | "Let's check that information. The format doesn't look quite right."                                                    |
| "You must..."                                                            | "We need to..." or "Let's..."                                                                                           |
| "Warning! Non-compliance detected!"                                      | "We noticed something needs attention. Let's fix it together."                                                          |
| "Failure"                                                                | "Let's try again" or "We can help with that"                                                                            |
| "Required field"                                                         | "[Field] is needed"                                                                                                     |
| "Submit now"                                                             | "Continue" or "Next step"                                                                                               |

### Emotion Mapping

Every interaction should make the user feel:

✅ **Safe** — "Your data is encrypted and secure"  
✅ **In Control** — "You can come back and finish this anytime"  
✅ **Understood** — "Based on what you told us, here's what applies"  
✅ **Guided** — "We'll walk you through this step by step"  
✅ **Protected** — "We handle the complex legal requirements for you"  
✅ **Confident** — "You're all set. Everything required is handled."

❌ **Never make them feel:**

- Threatened by legal language
- Overwhelmed by complexity
- Guilty or blamed for mistakes
- Abandoned or confused
- Uncertain about next steps

**Tone Adjustments:**

- Brief, clear, informative

## 🧪 Voice Testing Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

✅ Does this make the user feel **safer** and more **confident**?  
✅ Is this the **simplest** way to say it?  
✅ Would I say this to a **stressed friend** asking for help?  
✅ Does this **explain why**, not just what?  
✅ Am I **guiding**, not commanding?  
✅ Have I removed all **jargon** and **legalese**?  
✅ Is the next action **crystal clear**?

If any answer is "no," rewrite.
