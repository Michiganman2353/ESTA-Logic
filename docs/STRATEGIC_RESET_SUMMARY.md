# Strategic Reset Summary

## Executive Summary

ESTA-Logic has completed a formal strategic direction reset, transitioning from a technology-first platform to a **TurboTax-style guided compliance experience**.

## The Shift

### From

- A sophisticated technology platform users operate
- Feature-focused complexity
- Technical excellence that overshadows experience
- Engineering-driven design

### To

- A guided compliance partner that supports users
- Experience-focused simplicity
- Technical excellence that serves experience
- User experience-driven design

## Product Promise

- ✅ **Reassurance** — "You are safe" messaging

## Five Key Principles

1. **Guided, not exploratory** — Structured steps, not chaotic menus
2. **Confidence-driven, not tech-driven** — Emotional reassurance first
