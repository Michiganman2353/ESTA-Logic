## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Customer Experience First** — Never sacrifice usability for architecture
2. **Preserve Innovation** — Remove waste, never wisdom
3. **Strengthen, Don't Destabilize** — No regressions, ever
4. **Measure Everything** — Objective metrics drive decisions
5. **Controlled Risk** — Incremental, tested, reversible changes
6. **Trust Through Transparency** — Document the "why" always

## 💡 FAQ

**Q: Can we start multiple phases in parallel?**  
A: Phases 3, 4, 5 can run parallel after Phase 2. See dependency graph in charter.

**Q: What if a phase takes longer than estimated?**  
A: Update timeline in charter, communicate to stakeholders, adjust subsequent phases.

**Q: How do we handle breaking changes?**  
A: We don't. The charter requires backward compatibility and gradual migration.

**Q: What if we discover new issues during a phase?**  
A: Document in phase retrospective, update charter if needed, create follow-up phase if necessary.

**Q: Can we skip a phase?**  
A: No. Each phase builds on prior phases. Skipping risks destabilization.
