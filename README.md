# ESTA-Logic 🚀

> **"A WASM-native microkernel compliance engine for deterministic, secure, and modular execution of employer policies and state sick-time laws."**

**ESTA-Logic is a WASM-native microkernel compliance engine that provides deterministic, secure, isolated execution of employer policies and state sick-time laws inside a Tauri-powered runtime.**

ESTA-Logic is no longer a monolithic application. It is now a WASM-powered, microkernel-orchestrated compliance engine designed for deterministic, secure, and modular execution of state-level employee sick time rules (example: Michigan ESTA 2025 / MCL 408.963).

### Key Properties

- **Microkernel core (esta-kernel):** minimal Rust kernel that orchestrates message passing, capabilities, and module lifecycle.
- **WASM logic modules:** business logic (accruals, compliance checks, policy plugins) compiled to WASM and executed in a sandbox.
- **Tauri runtime host:** secure desktop/web host providing native capabilities and an IPC bridge for UI ⇄ kernel communication.
- **Deterministic and auditable:** identical inputs produce identical outputs; kernel logs provide verifiable audit trails.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture/architecture.md) for a full technical overview and migration plan.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22.11+ LTS** (required - see `.nvmrc`)
- npm ≥10.0.0
- Firebase account
- Vercel account (for deployment)

> ⚠️ **Important**: This project requires Node.js 22.11+ LTS. Earlier versions are not supported.

## ⚠️ Environment Configuration (MANDATORY)

**This section is critical for all environments. The application will not build or run without proper environment configuration.**

### Required Environment Variables

The following **6 Firebase configuration variables** are **MANDATORY** and must be configured in **ALL environments**:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

### Where to Configure

#### 🔹 Local Development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in all 6 `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variables with your Firebase project credentials
3. Get credentials from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project Settings → Web App

#### 🔹 Vercel Deployment

Configure all 6 variables in Vercel Dashboard for **ALL** environments:

- Production environment
- Preview environment
- Development environment

**Path:** Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables

#### 🔹 GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Add all 6 variables as **repository secrets**:

- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

**Path:** GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

### Important Notes

- ✅ **VITE\_** prefix is **required** for all frontend environment variables
- ❌ **REACT*APP*** variables are **NOT supported**
- ❌ **Unprefixed FIREBASE\_** variables are **NOT supported** for frontend
- ⚠️ All workflows, builds, and tests require these variables to succeed
- 🔒 **Security Note**: Firebase API keys with `VITE_` prefix are designed for client-side use and are safe to expose in the browser. Security is enforced by Firebase Security Rules, not by hiding these keys. See [Firebase Security Documentation](./docs/SECURITY.md) for details.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Michiganman2353/ESTA-Logic.git
   cd ESTA-Logic
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash

npm run test:frontend    # Run frontend tests
npm run test:backend     # Run backend tests
npm run test:e2e         # Run end-to-end tests

# Code Quality
npm run lint             # Lint all packages
npm run typecheck        # Type check all packages

# Nx Commands (for advanced usage)

## 🎼 Engineering Ecosystem Vision

> **"A codebase that functions as a cohesive, predictable, and beautiful symphony of engineering."**

ESTA-Logic operates as a fully orchestrated **engineering ecosystem** where every subsystem performs its role with precision. The architecture ensures that kernel logic, adapters, persistence, UI, CI/CD, compliance engines, and security controls operate in harmony.

### Unified Engineering Principles

| Principle                   | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Defined Responsibility**  | Every layer has a clear purpose, contract, and boundary      |
| **Explicit Interfaces**     | All components coordinate through stable, documented APIs    |
| **Deterministic Design**    | Built for clarity, predictability, and reproducible outcomes |
| **Cross-Subsystem Harmony** | Each subsystem hands off cleanly without friction            |

### The Symphony Analogy

The ESTA-Logic codebase functions like a **symphony orchestra**:

- **Conductor**: Nx build orchestration
- **Sheet Music**: ADRs, type definitions, contracts
- **Sections**: Subsystems (kernel, domain, applications)
- **Instruments**: Individual libraries and components
- **Rehearsals**: CI/CD pipeline, testing
- **Performance**: Production deployment

Each component knows its part, follows the conductor, reads the same music, and performs in harmony with others through explicit interfaces.

### Long-Term Platform Position

| Vision Element               | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Platform, Not Project**    | Positioned as an extensible platform for compliance automation                             |
| **Enterprise Ready**         | Prepared for audit scrutiny, investor evaluation, and adoption                             |
| **Structural Extensibility** | Future evolution (WASM, multi-state, payroll integrations) shaped around the cohesive core |

## Enterprise Subscription System 💳

> **"Build it once. Build it right. This system will process millions."**

The Enterprise Subscription System is the financial backbone of ESTA Tracker, engineered with financial-grade reliability, absolute data consistency, and zero-tolerance for revenue leakage.

### 🏗️ Core Architecture

#### Design Principles

| Principle                        | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Failure Is Not An Option**     | Every component engineered with financial-grade reliability and zero-tolerance for revenue leakage |
| **Scale Is Assumed**             | Architected for 10,000 concurrent subscriptions from day one, designed for 100x growth             |
| **Compliance Is Non-Negotiable** | PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR, and global tax compliance are foundational requirements                      |
