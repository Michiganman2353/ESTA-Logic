# Pre-Reset Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation from before the strategic reset to an experience-first, TurboTax-inspired guided compliance platform.

## Why These Were Archived

On December 19, 2025, ESTA-Logic underwent a strategic direction reset. These documents represented the previous technology-first approach and have been superseded by experience-first documentation.

## Archived Documents

### Technical Implementation Details (Pre-Reset)

- `COMPLIANCE_ENGINE_V2.md` - Previous compliance engine design
- `MODERNIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technology modernization summary
- `UI_MODERNIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - UI modernization (pre-experience-first)
- `OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Technical optimization guide

### Document Capture (Pre-Reset)
- `DOCUMENT_CAPTURE_CONFIG.md` - Technical configuration

## Philosophy Shift

### Before (Technology-First)
- Exposed technical complexity
- Feature-focused documentation
- Implementation-heavy guidance
- Engineering-driven design

### After (Experience-First)
- Hides technical complexity
- Journey-focused documentation
- User experience-heavy guidance
- User confidence-driven design

## Note

These documents are preserved for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the platform. They should not be used as current guidance.
