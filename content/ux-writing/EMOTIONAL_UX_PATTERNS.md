# ESTA Tracker Emotional UX Patterns

## Overview

Emotional UX Patterns organize copy and messaging by the user's emotional journey — not just by UI component. This document maps specific copy patterns to emotional states, ensuring every interaction builds trust, reduces anxiety, and guides users toward confidence.

**Purpose**: Provide emotional journey-specific copy that transforms users from fearful to confident advocates.

---

## 🎭 The Emotional Journey Framework

### The Transformation Arc

```
😰 Fear/Uncertainty  →  🤔 Curiosity  →  😌 Relief  →  ✅ Confidence  →  💚 Advocacy
     (Discovery)         (Onboarding)     (Success)    (Active Use)     (Long-term)
```

Every user starts somewhere on this arc. Our copy should always move them forward, never backward.
