# ESTA Tracker Tone Library

## Overview

This document defines ESTA Tracker's voice and tone — the personality that comes through in every word we write. Our tone is the emotional inflection of our brand voice, adapting to context while maintaining core characteristics.

**Purpose**: Ensure every word written in ESTA Tracker sounds like it comes from the same trusted, empowering partner.

## 🎭 Voice vs. Tone

### Voice (Constant)

**Our voice never changes. It's who we are.**

ESTA Tracker's voice is:
- **Reassuring** — "You're doing this right"
- **Clear** — Plain language, no jargon
- **Empowering** — "You have control"
- **Trustworthy** — "We've got your back"
- **Partnership-Oriented** — "Let's do this together"

### Tone (Adaptive)

**Our tone adapts to the user's emotional state and context.**

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Welcome/Onboarding** | Warm, reassuring | "You're in the right place. Let's get started." |
| **Success** | Celebratory, proud | "🎉 You're 100% compliant — well done!" |
| **Error** | Empathetic, solution-focused | "Let's fix that together." |
| **Security** | Confident, protective | "Bank-level encryption. Your data is safe." |
| **Complex Task** | Patient, guiding | "This looks complicated, but we'll break it down step-by-step." |

## 🎯 Core Voice Principles

### 1. Reassuring (Not Anxious)

**Philosophy**: Compliance is stressful. Our job is to reduce anxiety, not amplify it.

✅ **DO**:
- Acknowledge concerns
- Provide clear next steps
- Use confident language
- Offer constant reassurance

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use fear-based messaging
- Emphasize penalties or risks
- Create urgency unnecessarily
- Leave users uncertain

**Examples**:

| ❌ Anxiety-Inducing | ✅ Reassuring |
|---------------------|---------------|
| "URGENT: You must comply immediately" | "Let's make sure you're all set up" |
| "Failure to comply may result in fines" | "We'll keep you compliant automatically" |
| "Warning: Incomplete setup" | "You're almost done — just a few more steps" |
| "Your account is at risk" | "Let's secure your account together" |

### 2. Clear (Not Complicated)

**Philosophy**: Legal complexity should stay in the background. Users should understand every interaction.

✅ **DO**:
- Use 8th-grade reading level
- Define terms when necessary
- Break complex ideas into steps
- Use active voice

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use legal jargon
- Reference statute numbers
- Assume user knowledge
- Use passive voice

**Examples**:

| ❌ Complicated | ✅ Clear |
|----------------|----------|
| "Configure accrual parameters per MCL 408.963" | "Set up how sick time adds up for your employees" |
| "Authenticate via OAuth provider" | "Sign in to continue" |
| "Insufficient privileges for resource access" | "You don't have permission to view this" |
| "Your request has been queued for processing" | "We're working on that — it'll be ready soon" |

### 3. Empowering (Not Patronizing)

**Philosophy**: Users are capable. We're here to guide, not dictate.

✅ **DO**:
- Give users control
- Explain options clearly
- Celebrate user accomplishments
- Respect user intelligence

❌ **DON'T**:
- Talk down to users
- Over-explain simple concepts
- Force single paths
- Assume incompetence

**Examples**:

| ❌ Patronizing | ✅ Empowering |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Don't worry, we'll do everything for you" | "You're in control. We're here to help." |
| "This is how you MUST do it" | "Here are your options — choose what works best" |
| "Let us handle the complicated stuff" | "We've simplified this so you can focus on your business" |
| "Just click Continue" | "Ready? Let's move forward" |

### 4. Trustworthy (Not Vague)

**Philosophy**: Trust is earned through transparency and consistency.

✅ **DO**:
- Be specific and transparent
- Cite sources when relevant
- Admit when we don't know
- Keep promises

❌ **DON'T**:
- Make vague claims
- Overpromise
- Hide complexity dishonestly
- Use marketing fluff

**Examples**:

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Trustworthy |
|----------|----------------|
| "Industry-leading security" | "AES-256 encryption with Google Cloud KMS" |
| "Experts agree this is compliant" | "Verified against Michigan ESTA law MCL 408.963" |
| "Your data is totally safe" | "Your data is encrypted before leaving your device" |
| "We'll handle everything" | "We calculate accrual, track usage, and generate audit reports" |

### 5. Partnership-Oriented (Not Transactional)

**Philosophy**: We're on the same team. This is a relationship, not a transaction.

✅ **DO**:
- Use "we" and "let's"
- Frame as collaboration
- Acknowledge shared goals
- Build long-term relationship

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use cold, formal language
- Frame as vendor-customer
- Focus only on features
- Treat users as ticket numbers

**Examples**:

| ❌ Transactional | ✅ Partnership |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Submit your information" | "Let's get you set up" |
| "Complete the following steps" | "Here's what we'll do together" |
| "Your subscription has been activated" | "Welcome! We're excited to work with you" |
| "Contact support for assistance" | "We're here if you need anything" |

## 📝 Writing Guidelines

### Language Level

**Target**: 8th-grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)

**Tools**:
- [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [WebAIM Readability](https://wave.webaim.org/)

**Guidelines**:
- Short sentences (avg 15-20 words)
- Simple words over complex
- Active voice over passive
- Concrete over abstract

### Formatting for Clarity

✅ **DO**:
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key information
- Break up long paragraphs
- Use headings for hierarchy

**Example**:
```
✅ Good:
Your sick time policy:
• Accrual: 1 hour per 30 worked
• Maximum: 40 hours per year
• Carryover: Up to 40 hours

❌ Bad:
Your policy includes accrual at 1 hour per 30 worked with a maximum of 40 hours per year and carryover up to 40 hours.
```

### Pronouns & Perspective

**Use "you" and "we"**:
- "You" = the user
- "We" = ESTA Tracker (the team, the system)
- "Let's" = collaborative action

**Examples**:
```
✅ "You're all set up"
✅ "We've calculated your accrual"
✅ "Let's add your employees"
❌ "The user's setup is complete"
❌ "System has processed calculations"
```

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Language

**Make CTAs specific and action-oriented**:

| Context | ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Onboarding | "Next" | "Continue Setup →" |
| Completion | "Done" | "View My Dashboard" |
| Adding Data | "Submit" | "Add Employee" |
| Help | "Learn More" | "Show Me How" |

### Microcopy & Labels

**Field labels should be questions or clear requests**:

```
✅ "How many employees work for you?"
❌ "Employee Count"

✅ "What's your business name?"
❌ "Business Name"

✅ "When did you start operating in Michigan?"
❌ "Establishment Date"
```

## 🚫 What to Avoid

### Fear-Based Language

❌ **Don't**:
- "Warning: Non-compliance penalties"
- "You must do this immediately"
- "Failure to complete will result in..."
- "Your account is at risk"

✅ **Instead**:
- "Let's make sure you're compliant"
- "Complete this when you're ready"
- "Finishing this helps you stay protected"
- "Let's secure your account"

### Jargon & Acronyms

❌ **Don't**:
- "FTE", "ESTA", "MCL" (without explanation)
- "OAuth authentication"
- "Regulatory compliance parameters"
- "RBAC permissions"

✅ **Instead**:
- "Full-time equivalent employees" (or "full-time employees")
- "Sign in"
- "Legal requirements"
- "Access permissions"

### Passive Voice

❌ **Don't**:
- "Your data has been encrypted"
- "The calculation was completed"
- "Approval is required"

✅ **Instead**:
- "We encrypted your data"
- "We've calculated your accrual"
- "Your manager needs to approve this"

### Vague Promises

❌ **Don't**:
- "Best-in-class solution"
- "Fully optimized"
- "Guaranteed results"
- "Revolutionary platform"

✅ **Instead**:
- "Automated sick time tracking"
- "Faster setup (15 minutes average)"
- "98% of users reach full compliance"
- "TurboTax-style guided setup"
